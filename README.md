# üíª Tech Stack:
## Top Tier Absolute GIGA Chad
![D](https://img.shields.io/badge/D-%23CC342D?style=for-the-badge) is the most underrated Rust killer that no one knows about...borrow checker and all the safety without the headaches.

![Gleam](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gleam-%23ff00ee?style=for-the-badge) on BEAM is wet dreams not memes.

![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/scala-%23DC322F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scala&logoColor=white) to infinity and beyond with akka at side / Gleam of JVM.

![Nim](https://img.shields.io/badge/nim-%23FFE953.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=nim&logoColor=white) not so noble...hack the planet with malware dev.

![Zig](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zig-%23F7A41D.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=zig&logoColor=white) C replacement with better tooling also when nim project gets fingerprinted compile again with zig for round 2.

## Down To Code
![Lua](https://img.shields.io/badge/lua-%232C2D72.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=lua&logoColor=white) Embeds in everything just annoyingly starts at 1 and only tables to use.

![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/dart-%230175C2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white) Can see this replacing javascript and also has flutter.

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white) Can make pretty decent servers and very light vm.

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white) Bang head against wall fighting borrow checker till it works...but its stable and safe when it does.

[![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-%23FFFFFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=godot-engine)](#) Good free as in freedom and price game engine if you hate unity like I do and need replacement. 
## Just Because Meta And Somewhat Useful
![Bun](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bun-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bun&logoColor=white) Project generator and JavaScript/TypeScript runner when held at gunpoint to deal with those.

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) Please save me from being hostage...at least it has fake types so can copium.

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) Actually decent but like......nvm just copium and emotional attachment.

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white) Useful (especially on Windows) if dont bother with GUI (unless on Windows)...now you see the problem. not really "Cross Platform" now is it...

## Dont Even @ Me..Burn It With Fire
[![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=000)](#) Bro like this is the most dogshit language anyone has ever made and you cant say no. Not even copium its trash.

[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](#) Someone must be from India or stuck in some ancient job that refuses to change ways because this is just boomer. Use Scala instead or hell even Clojure.

[![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)](#) Ok to be fair this should be in Just because meta but its just so outclassed by so much else now that its irrelivant...and always insecure. Look up CVE...

[![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ruby-%23CC342D.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=ruby&logoColor=white)](#) Rails is dead...this is dead...who even maintains anything in this anymore...I used to love this language so much but its dead...why bother...

[![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=unity&logoColor=white)](#) üñïüî•‚ò†Ô∏èüñïüî•‚ò†Ô∏èüñïüî•‚ò†Ô∏èüñï Just use Godot! üñïüî•‚ò†Ô∏èüñïüî•‚ò†Ô∏èüñïüî•‚ò†Ô∏èüñï
