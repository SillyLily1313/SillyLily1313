## The Only Languages You Should Use

![Crystal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Crystal-000000?style=for-the-badge) easy syntax like ruby, safe, modern, and still generic. win, win, win, win!

![Julia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Julia-9558B2?style=for-the-badge) can do what Python does but better, actually compiles, and distributed! win, win, win!

![LilyLang](https://img.shields.io/badge/LilyLang-725D85?style=for-the-badge) https://github.com/SillyLily1313/lilylang. not as needed much anymore but a win where needed. 

![Gleam](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gleam-%23ff00ee?style=for-the-badge) on BEAM is wet dreams not memes...Static typing, functional, fast, fault tolerant, distributed. win, win, win, win, win!

![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/scala-%23DC322F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scala&logoColor=white) to infinity and beyond with akka at side / Gleam of JVM. win, win, win, win, win!

![Zig](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zig-%23F7A41D.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=zig&logoColor=white) c replacement with better tooling also when nim project gets fingerprinted compile again with zig for round 2. win, win, win!

![Lua](https://img.shields.io/badge/lua-%232C2D72.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=lua&logoColor=white) embeds in everything, good for a configs language or mods / plugins, MoonScript to make it better. win, win, win!

## Just Because Meta

![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/dart-%230175C2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white) can see this replacing javascript and also has flutter. just not too popular yet, isolates are single threaded.

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white) can make pretty decent servers and very light vm. if err != nill, channels can be overused, etc. 

![Nim](https://img.shields.io/badge/nim-%23FFE953.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=nim&logoColor=white) not so noble...hack the planet with malware dev. just be aware of AV knowing everything in nim is malware.

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white) bang head against wall fighting borrow checker till it works...but its stable and safe when it does.

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) please save me from being hostage...at least it has fake types so can copium. did i mention all the types are fake? it compiles to javascript which undoes your types...your types only stay in engines like bun that do typescript directly. 

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) actually decent but like......nvm just copium and emotional attachment. random whitespacing errors / inconsistent white space (tabs vs spaces), slow AF to other languages, mojo not yet for windows to take advantage of speed hacks. have to use c libraries for decent performance / mojo.

## Dont Even @ Me..Burn It With Fire

[![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=000)](#) bro like this is the most dogshit language anyone has ever made and you cant say no. Not even copium its trash.

[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](#) someone must be from India or stuck in some ancient job that refuses to change ways because this is just boomer. Use Scala instead or hell even Clojure.

[![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)](#) ok to be fair this should be in Just because meta but its just so outclassed by so much else now that its irrelivant...and always insecure. Look up CVE...

[![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ruby-%23CC342D.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=ruby&logoColor=white)](#) rails is dead...this is dead...who even maintains anything in this anymore...I used to love this language so much but its dead...why bother...

[![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=unity&logoColor=white)](#) 🖕🔥☠️🖕🔥☠️🖕🔥☠️🖕 Just use Godot! 🖕🔥☠️🖕🔥☠️🖕🔥☠️🖕
